  <h1>Overtly Stalin Developer Diary</h1>
  <h2>9/9/2025</h2>
  <p>This is a developer diary that I am going to try and maintain for the development of my game: working title 'Overtly Stalin.' This is a reference to another popular 
  social deduction game Secret Hitler. 
  
  I had originaly run one playtesting session with some friends online at the start of May when I was most active on this project. We played with a total of 7 or 8 people
  and it was a decent enough time, bar the unbalanced nature of the game and the middling gameplay loop (plus technical difficulties to boot). The main problem I wish to talk about is the 
  gameplay loop. The current gameplay loop revolves around 3 roles being passed around the table: deputy secretary, orgburo minister and military director. This is heavily inspired and modified
  from Secret Hitler, but there are a few problems. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The deputy secretary is too weak. The idea of the deputy secretary is twofold. Firstly, it mirrors the thematic idea that the political organs of the USSR interplays heavily with the
    state functions. Secondly, in a gameplay sense, the deputy secretary is necessary to ensure some degree of chaos, to allow people to bypass the usual system of manipulating the frontline deck. However
    this ended up being too underpowered and this role was the least important one.</li>
    <li>Information was too readily available.</li>
  </ul>
