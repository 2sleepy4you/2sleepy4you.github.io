  <h1>Overtly Stalin Developer Diary</h1>
  <h2>9/9/2025</h2>
  <p>This is a developer diary that I am going to try and maintain for the development of my game: working title 'Overtly Stalin.' This is a reference to another popular 
  social deduction game Secret Hitler. See <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vNdmLDUpT2UYUQn2q0HUYkdmaxy14bR8y3e-EXuOcd0/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> for the initial rule set (which is partly incomplete).
  
  I had originaly run one playtesting session with some friends online at the start of May when I was most active on this project. We played with a total of 7 or 8 people
  and it was a decent enough time, bar the unbalanced nature of the game and the middling gameplay loop (plus technical difficulties to boot). The main problem I wish to talk about is the 
  gameplay loop. The current gameplay loop revolves around 3 roles being passed around the table: deputy secretary, orgburo minister and military director. This is heavily inspired and modified
  from Secret Hitler, but there are a few problems. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Information was too readily available. Stalin had often too solid of a grasp of the frontline when the intention was for the players to be intentional in hiding that information.
    This leads to the next point.</li>
    <li>
      There was too much cooperation. Each of the major power players in the Soviet Union were always out looking for themselves. They were not going to stand idly by and let others get ahead
      whilst they get left behind. However, there was not any hint of this in the game. In part, there was no incentive to play deceitfully to those on your fellow team, since your goal was to
      win after all.
    </li>
        <li>
      The frontline mechanic not being dynamic enough. Part of the problem the comes with the previous two points is that the frontline board mechanic, being the only mechanic for the players to 
          interface with and actually affect the outcome of the game, was extremely underwhelming. It did not generate the intrigue, drama, and tension I had hoped for between players.
    </li>
    <li>The deputy secretary is too weak. The idea of the deputy secretary is twofold. Firstly, it mirrors the thematic idea that the political organs of the USSR interplays heavily with the
    state functions. Secondly, in a gameplay sense, the deputy secretary is necessary to ensure some degree of chaos, to allow people to bypass the usual system of manipulating the frontline deck. However
    this ended up being too underpowered and this role was the least important one. </li>
  </ul>
  In any case, I am in the process of redesigning the game.

  <h1>9/14/2025</h1>
  <p>
    After having spoken with a good friend about my new thoughts on the game, I will list it out here. The list of roles will be expanded to 6 total:
    <ul>
      <li>Deputy Secretary</li>
      <li>Orgburo Chairman</li>
      <li>Commissar of War</li>
      <li>Commissar of Labor</li>
      <li>Commissar of Agriculture</li>
      <li>Commissar of Industry</li>
    </ul>
  Roughly speaking, the first 3 roles will have very distinct powers that affect different parts of the game. The last 3 roles will play a sort of 'worker placement' game. I will go over some of the 
  big changes that I thought are interesting to hit on:
  <h2>Deputy Secretary</h2>
  The Deputy Secretary is getting a major rework from last time. They will still occupy a largely political role, but with more direct impact. The Deputy Secretary is now capable of redistributing 
  government roles. Note that they cannot distribute all roles, but only government ones. Political roles such as the Deputy Secretary and the Orgburo Chairman must be voted on at the Central Committee
  meeting (or possibly named the Party Congress? Unsure yet.) They also have the ability to give objectives for the 5 year plan. Meeting these 'sub-objectives' of the 5 year plan would net benefits
  for the USSR in its war. Whether this leaves the Deputy Secretary still too powerless is subject to playtesting.

  <h2>Orgburo Chairman</h2>

  The Orgburo Chairman has the task of distributing officers/workers/specialists to people who want them. It will be difficult because a wrecker in this position would have to determine the most 
    effective way to sabotage the plans of the Stalinists and a Stalinist would have to decide how to carefully spread the limited amount of useful cards to everyone who wants them. 
    In this way, they are determined to be the 'secret power' behind the throne, the role that seems as if they have relatively low impact but whose effects are found to be compounded over time.
<h2>Commissars of Labor, Agriculture and Industry</h2>

  As said befoore, these roles correspond to a 'worker placement' game wherein they fight over both a shared pool of workers and land for which they need to do effectively carry out their
  actions. Effective cooperation is necessary to get the Soviet war machine up and running against the Wehrmacht, but wreckers also have the ability to sabotage by playing poorly.

  <h2>General Gameplay Changes</h2>
  One major change that I see for this new edition is to allow for more infighting amongst the Stalinists. To that end, there is a secondary objective for Stalinists: become Stalin's successor. 
  To do this, they must utilize their political and government positions to enrich themselves. Whoever is the most enriched becomes Stalin's successor. This does not affect Stalin's victory at all, 
  but a secondary victory only counted by those Stalinist aligned players.
</p>
<h2>10/6/2025</h2>
  <p>
    I have been contending with a few things related to the gameplay process. First, how do we incentivize stalinists to play unoptimally in exchange for a personal benefit and, second, how do we give the 
    orgburo chairman more power? The first point is an obvious ask I think. We want for stalinist players to draw the suspicion unto themselves in order to give the wreckers a proper chance.
    Secondly, giving the orgburo minister more power increases the dependency and intricate social interplay in the game. 

    For the first, point I have a couple ideas. One idea is that certain resources could be sold for more 'political power'. Currently, the resources are: food, oil, and weaponry. My current thought is
    to allow the wholesale of food and weapons. This can be thought of in the context of the game as selling food to friends and lackeys of the players within the USSR and selling weapons abroad. Naturally, 
    selling weapons will net greater political power. The logic being: since you would be selling to other powers, you are building goodwill, and having good relations with foreign countries is a good trait
    to have in a future leader. However, the downside of selling weapons is that some might end up in the hands of the Germans, giving them a boost in the war overall. Another way to gain political power is 
    to place loyalists within the government agencies. 

    For the second, I think it may be a good idea for the cards to have certain suits. The reason being, having more variability in the cards that matter allows for the orgburo to have more control and have 
    demands out of those who need cards. In this way, each player in government position plays a sort of deck building game wherein getting good hands from ones deck gives a player the ability to gain bonuses.
    In this way, the orgburo can extract concessions out of those who want to complete their deck.
