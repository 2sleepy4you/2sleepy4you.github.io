  <p>Many of the following were written over the course of my undergraduate time at the University of Florida. As such, you may notice changes in the style of writing and formatting. </p>
  <h1>Unpublished Papers, Expositories and Talks</h1>
  <p>The following was a paper I wrote as part of a summer research project with a professor at UF. The results and methods are definitely unorthodox looking back on this, but I had a very fun time participating in this project and learned many new math concepts as well as about the research process in mathematics.</p>

  <p>The following is an expository paper I wrote as part of a Combinatorics class exploring graph graph partitions. Utilizing the Laplacian matrix of a graph and analyzing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, someone can holistically determine well/highly connected subgraphs and partition the graph accordingly. This is one of the earliest papers I have written as an undergraduate. 

    Special thanks to my friend Justin Berke for creating a graph program that remains useful to this day.

  <p>The following was a talk I gave for the University Math Society where I defined symmetric polynomials and gave interesting combinatorial results involving them. </p>

  <p>The following was a talk I gave for the University Math Society where I sought to prove a fundamental and quite interesting result in the intersection of topology and logic. </p>

  <p>The following was a talk I gave for the University Math Society where I defined a notion of set cut outs and gave a very interesting classification of them. This result is linked to Vapnik Chervonenkis theory and came from a reading course I had with a professor on O-minimal structures and tame topology.</p>
