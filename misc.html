  <h1>Board Games</h1>
  <p>I love board games. I own many games and I particularly like board games which are often described as 'eurogames.' These games often involve less player interaction and no player elimination. The following are a few games that I have played and am fond of.</p>\

  <p>I have also developed many games. I am currently in the middle of developing and playtesting a social deduction game tentatively called 'Great Purge.' It is heavily inspired by <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/188834/secret-hitler">Secret Hitler</a>, a popular social deduction game. The game is set in the 1940s and each player plays a member of the Politburo of the Soviet Union. One player is designated as Stalin, and everyone else is either aligned in Stalin's interests (the Stalinists) or in opposition (the Wreckers).</p>
